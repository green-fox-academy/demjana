      <h2>Doggos</h2>
      <p>
        This is an awesome page abbout doggos that I copied from <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog">Wikipedia.</a>
        The domestic dog (Canis lupus familiaris when considered a subspecies of the wolf or Canis
        familiaris when considered a distinct species)[5] is a mammal, a member of the genus Canis
        (canines), which forms part of the wolf-like canids,[6] and is the most widely abundant
        terrestrial carnivore.[7][8][9][10][11] The dog and the extant gray wolf are sister
        taxa[12][13][14] as modern wolves are not closely related to the wolves that were first
        domesticated,[13][14] which implies that the direct ancestor of the dog is extinct.[15] The
        dog was the first species to be domesticated,[14][16] and has been selectively bred over
        millennia for various behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical attributes.[17] Their
        long
        association with humans has led dogs to be uniquely attuned to human behavior[18] and they
        are
        able to thrive on a starch-rich diet that would be inadequate for other canids.[19] Dogs
        vary
        widely in shape, size and colors.[20] They perform many roles for humans, such as hunting,
        herding, pulling loads, protection, assisting police and military, companionship and, more
        recently, aiding disabled people and therapeutic roles. This influence on human society has
        given them the sobriquet of "man's best friend".

      <h2>Origin</h2>
      <p>
        Main article: Origin of the domestic dog
        The origin of the domestic dog includes the dog's evolutionary divergence from the wolf, its
        domestication, and its development into dog types and dog breeds. The dog is a member of the
        genus Canis, which forms part of the wolf-like canids, and was the first species and the
        only large carnivore to have been domesticated.[14][26] The dog and the extant gray wolf are
        sister taxa, as modern wolves are not closely related to the population of wolves that was
        first domesticated.[14]

        The genetic divergence between dogs and wolves occurred between 40,000–20,000 years ago,
        just before or during the Last Glacial Maximum.[27][2] This timespan represents the upper
        time-limit for the commencement of domestication because it is the time of divergence and
        not the time of domestication, which occurred later.[27][28] The domestication of animals
        commenced over 15,000 years ago, beginning with the grey wolf (Canis lupus) by nomadic
        hunter-gatherers.[27] The archaeological record and genetic analysis show the remains of the
        Bonn–Oberkassel dog buried beside humans 14,200 years ago to be the first undisputed dog,
        with disputed remains occurring 36,000 years ago. The domestication of the dog predates
        agriculture.[2] It was not until 11,000 years ago that people living in the Near East
        entered into relationships with wild populations of aurochs, boar, sheep, and goats.[27]

        Where the domestication of the dog took place remains debated, with the most plausible
        proposals spanning Western Europe,[9][28] Central Asia[28][29] and East Asia.[28][30] This
        has been made more complicated by the recent proposal that an initial wolf population split
        into East and West Eurasian groups. These two groups, before going extinct, were
        domesticated independently into two distinct dog populations between 14,000 and 6,400 years
        ago. The Western Eurasian dog population was gradually and partially replaced by East Asian
        dogs introduced by humans at least 6,400 years ago.[28][2] This proposal is also debated.[2]

      <h2 id="labradors">Labrador Retriever</h2>
      <p>
        Labrador (/læbrəˈdɔːr/ lab-rə-DOR) is a geographic and cultural region within the Canadian
        province of Newfoundland and Labrador. It is the continental portion of the province and
        constitutes 71% of the province's area but is home to only 6% of the province's population.
        It is separated from the island of Newfoundland by the Strait of Belle Isle. It is the
        largest and northernmost geographical region in Atlantic Canada.

        Labrador occupies most of the eastern part of the Labrador Peninsula. It is bordered to the
        west and the south by the Canadian province of Quebec. Labrador also shares a small land
        border with the Canadian territory of Nunavut on Killiniq Island.

        The aboriginal peoples of Labrador include the Northern Inuit of Nunatsiavut, the Southern
        Inuit-Métis of Nunatukavut (NunatuKavut), and the Innu.

        Labrador has its own anthem, the Ode to Labrador.

      <h2 id="golden-retrivers">Golden Retriever</h2>
      <p>
        The Golden Retriever is a medium-large gun dog that retrieves shot waterfowl, such as ducks
        and upland game birds, during hunting and shooting parties.[3] The name "retriever" refers
        to the breed's ability to retrieve shot game undamaged due to their soft mouth. Golden
        retrievers have an instinctive love of water, and are easy to train to basic or advanced
        obedience standards. They are a long-coated breed, with a dense inner coat that provides
        them with adequate warmth in the outdoors, and an outer coat that lies flat against their
        bodies and repels water. Golden retrievers are well suited to residency in suburban or
        country environments.[4] They shed copiously, particularly at the change of seasons, and
        require fairly regular grooming. The Golden Retriever was originally bred in Scotland in the
        mid-19th century.[3][5]

        The breed is a prominent participant in conformation shows for purebred dogs. The Golden
        Retriever is popular as a disability assistance dog, such as being a guide dog for the blind
        and a hearing dog for the deaf. In addition, they are trained to be a hunting dog, a
        detection dog, and a search and rescue participant. The breed's friendly, gentle temperament
        means it is unsuited to being a professional guard dog, but its temperament has also made it
        the third-most popular family dog breed (by registration) in the United States,[6] the
        fifth-most popular in Brazil[7] and Australia,[8] and the eighth-most popular in the United
        Kingdom.[9] Golden Retrievers are rarely choosy eaters, but require ample (two or more hours
        a day) exercise.[10] The breed is fond of play but also highly trainable.

      <h2 id="vizsla">Vizsla</h2>
      <p>The Vizsla (Hungarian: [ˈviʒlɒ])[a] is a dog breed from Hungary and belongs to the FCI
        group 7 (Pointer group). The Hungarian or Magyar Vizsla are sporting dogs and loyal
        companions. The Vizsla's medium size is one of the breed's most appealing characteristics.
        As a hunter of fowl and upland game, the Vizsla has held a prominent position among sporting
        dogs – that of household companion and family dog.

        The Vizsla is a natural hunter endowed with an excellent nose and outstanding trainability.
        It was bred to work in fields, forests or bodies of water. Although they are lively,
        gentle-mannered, demonstrably affectionate and sensitive, they are also fearless and possess
        a well-developed protective instinct.[3]</p>
